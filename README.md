# Rising Tides
A website that predicts weather a location will be flooded by rising sea levels

# About This Project
Rising Tides was built for the 2021 LA Hacks hackathon to bring awareness to the devastating impact that rising sea levels will have on millions of people. Rising Tides takes in a location selected from a map and returns how likely that location will be flooded in the next 80 years.
